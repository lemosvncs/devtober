# Game Objective and PJD:

The main goal for each scene is to power-up the Planar-Jump-Drive (PJD), a unique artifact for each hero that empowers the hero to jump from one plane to another.
The PJD is a card that is always the first card of the deck. When it's put on a tile, it's active and must be protected and powered. If destroyed, it's the end of the game. If it's reach its full power, it is a win.
The PJD will have different means of activation depending on the hero chosen.

## Yah & Penitence Machine

Penitence is Yah's PJD. It's powered mainly by the Yah's losing health as a proof of his faith. As such, each time Yah loses health, the Penitence Machine gains *one* power.

Yah's deck must have cards that might heal him, but also cards that inflict himself with damage in orther to achieve a goal.

Yah maybe a buffed out priest-like dude.

## Gurdaban & The Goblinoid Engine

Gurdaban is a globin and goblins construct things out of other things. Each time Gudaban destroys something, being it a enemy or a structure, he get's a card that he can place on the groud. Each turn, there's a chance (since it's improvised) that that card will produce power.

## Catarina & Chaotic System.

Catarina is a Sorcerer that finds power in disturbing the balance of entropy. Each time she casts magic, she rolls a d20, if it is a 20, she finds power in the chaos of the universe itself. Each magic also greatens the chance that she'll be successful on the power find test. 
<!--There's a chance she will find power each time she casts a spell. The more spells she cast, greater the chance. -->
